# 🎧 Headphones Landing Page

This project is a **responsive landing page** built from scratch using only **HTML and CSS**, as part of the ALX Front-End curriculum.

The objective is to recreate a provided Figma design exactly — across **desktop**, **tablet**, and **mobile** screen sizes — without using any external CSS frameworks or JavaScript.

---

## Design Reference

All styles, layout spacing, and fonts follow the official Figma design file. You can duplicate it into your own drafts for inspection and development.

**Design Sources:**
- Font: [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
- Font: Spin Cycle OT (available from free font sites)

---

## Responsive Design Notes

- The page adapts based on screen size using media queries.
- **Mobile version** is triggered when screen width is **≤ 480px**.
- Layout changes are made to ensure usability on smaller screens.

---

## Interactions

- All **links** use hover/active state color: `#FF6565`
- All **buttons** reduce opacity to `0.9` on hover/active
- Maximum content width is `1000px` and centered horizontally.
